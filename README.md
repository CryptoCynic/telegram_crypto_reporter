# ðŸ¤– TGCryptoReporter

A Python-based tool that scrapes cryptocurrency-related Telegram channels, analyzes content using AI (OpenAI or Google Gemini), and generates comprehensive market insights.

**Attention**: It might take time to run due to number of messages to be analyzed. Either alter the channel list to a shorter one or input just 1 or 2 in the argument --hours. Openai model method is not working for the moment but consider using Gemini by getting a [free API key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).
